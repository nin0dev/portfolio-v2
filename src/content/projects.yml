    title: Reboot! Hackathon â€“ Spiro
    description: >-
      The "Reboot!" workshop gives to students the opportunity to think about a
      solution for communicating around our world's environmental issues.

      Me and my group created a board game similar to Cluedo, where crimes are of an ecological nature.

      We were rewarded with an Honorable Mention for the "Prix Reboot Communication responsable 2023".

      An awesome week, thank you team!
